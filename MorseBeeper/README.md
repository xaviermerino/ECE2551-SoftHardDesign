## Morse Beeper

#### Overview
A **beeper** is a wireless communication device that receives and sends messages to others using its internal transceiver. In this project, we design and prototype a device that resembles a beeper and is able to store contacts, send, and receive **morse code** messages. 

This project involves interfacing with an **LCD** screen, a **radio** module, the **EEPROM**, and a **buzzer**. We also design and implement an easy to navigate user interface in a constrained 16x2 screen while managing external **interrupts** and handling data **storage**. 

In the end, all devices that follow this guideline should be able to communicate as described in this document.

**What you will need:**
* Arduino LCD Keypad Shield
* Piezo Buzzer
* NRF24L01+ module

**In the process you will:**
* Interface with a **Liquid Crystal Display** (LCD) component.
* Use a voltage divider as an **analog input** to detect button presses.
* Interface with an **NRF2401L+** module via SPI to communicate with other modules.
* Use **interrupts** to process incoming messages.
* Interface with a piezo **buzzer** to notify user of events.
* Interface with the Arduino’s **EEPROM** to store long-term data that can be retrieved after a power cycle.
* Use the **Watchdog Timer**'s jitter to generate random byte sequences.
* Implement a beeper as a **state machine**.
* Apply the concept of abstractions in C++ by defining **classes** and instantiating **objects** from those classes to promote re-usability and increased efficiency.
* Use **inheritance** to extend Arduino’s classes.
* Use **pointers** to handle dynamic memory allocation.

#### Entropy Class
If we compare our beeper to a cellphone you'll agree that we need to assign it a phone number. Imagine that your phone number is `321-123-4567`. If you were not guaranteed that this number belonged **only** to you, then someone else (who shares your number) could also be getting your calls and texts. 

![alicebob](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaviermerino/ECE2551-SoftHardDesign/master/MorseBeeper/alicebob.png)

We use the term **universally unique identifier (UUID)** to refer to a number that is used to uniquely identify some entity. The probability that a **UUID** will be duplicated is not zero but it is low enough to be considered negligible.

We are going to use the `Entropy` class to generate a sequence of random bytes using the `Watchdog Timer`'s natural jitter. These bytes will become our unique identifier. You can find the class [here](https://github.com/pmjdebruijn/Arduino-Entropy-Library/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

#### NR24 Class
The `nRF24L01+` is a single chip radio transceiver that operates in the 2.4 - 2.5 GHz band. It features ultra low power consumption and speeds up to 2 Mbps. We need to use a microcontroller to configure this radio through a **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)**. You can download the datasheet [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf).

![nrf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaviermerino/ECE2551-SoftHardDesign/master/MorseBeeper/nrf.png)

The `nRF24L01+` implements the concept of data pipes. **Pipes** are logical channels in the physical RF **channel**. Each pipe is assigned its own physical address for subsequent write or read operations. Each address is 40-bit long. This radio is able to write data to one pipe or to listen for data from up to six pipes. 

![pipes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaviermerino/ECE2551-SoftHardDesign/master/MorseBeeper/multiceiver.png)

We need to generate a 40-bit UUID to assign to our radio's receiving data pipe to minimize the chances of two radios having the same address during lab. It is important to ensure that the address that you assign to the radio's receiving data pipe is **unique**. 

We will use the [`NR24` library](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24) to control the radio. Documentation for the library can be found [here](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24/).

The following table describes how to wire your `NRF24L01+` module. **Please note that the module can not operate at 5V.**

| Name 	| Description           	| Connected To 	|
|------	|-----------------------	|--------------	|
| CE   	| Chip Enable (RX / TX) 	| A1           	|
| CSN  	| SPI Chip Select       	| A2           	|
| MOSI 	| SPI Slave Data Input  	| 11 or ICSP-4 	|
| MISO 	| SPI Slave Data Output 	| 12 or ICSP-1 	|
| SCK  	| SPI Clock             	| 13 or ICSP-3 	|
| IRQ  	| Maskable Interrupt    	| 2            	|
| VCC  	| Power (1.9V - 3.6V)   	| 3.3 V        	|
| GND  	| Ground (0V)           	| GND          	|

#### LCDKeypad Class
The LCD library, [`LiquidCrystal`](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal), allows you to control displays that are compatible with the **Hitachi HD 44780** driver. 

The LCD Keypad Shield provided looks like this:

![lcdkeypad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaviermerino/ECE2551-SoftHardDesign/master/MorseBeeper/lcdkeypadpins.png)

The following table describes which pins are used by the shield.

|  Pin 	| Description     	|  Pin  | Description |
|-------------	|-----------------	| -------------|---|
| A0          	| Buttons         	| 7  | LCD DB7 |      
| 4           	| LCD DB4         	| 8  | LCD RS  |
| 5           	| LCD DB5         	| 9  | LCD Enable |    
| 6           	| LCD DB6         	| 10 | Backlight Control |  

From the picture above you can see that the shield is equipped with the following buttons:
* Select
* Left
* Up
* Down
* Right
* Reset

These buttons (with the exception of the reset button) are wired to pin `A0` using a **voltage divider**. The value at pin `A0` depends on which button was pressed. A portion of the schematic is presented below. 

![lcdkeypad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaviermerino/ECE2551-SoftHardDesign/master/MorseBeeper/voltagedivider.png)

The **resistances** used in your shield might vary depending on the manufacturer. You will need this information when calculating the expected value for a button press. For instance, when button `UP` is pressed, the voltage at pin `A0` can be found using **Ohm's law**.

![lcdkeypad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaviermerino/ECE2551-SoftHardDesign/master/MorseBeeper/ohmslaw.png)

> Alternatively, you can obtain this information with a multimeter or by reading the value at the pin when a button is pressed. The complete schematic can be found [here](http://image.dfrobot.com/image/data/DFR0009/LCDKeypad%20Shield%20V1.0%20SCH.pdf). 

The Arduino reads the value at the pin and provides a number ranging from `0 - 1023` corresponding to the input voltage. Since we calculated the voltage at pin `A0` to be `0.7081 V` we can proceed to map this value to reflect the Arduino's **10-bit ADC** resolution. We know that `5V` is represented by the decimal value `1023` and that `0V` is represented by `0`. We can now map the value accordingly using the **Rule of Three**. We find out that the value at the pin read by the Arduino is around `144`.

You will use **inheritance** to create an `LCDKeypad` class which will:
* Extend the `LiquidCrystal` class.
* Define the following `enum` to make your code more readable:

```cpp
typedef enum {LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, SELECT, NONE} Button;
```

* Implement **debouncing** for the analog input wired at pin `A0`. Define and implement the function `getButtonPress()` which returns the button that was pressed. The function prototype is provided below.

```cpp
Button getButtonPress();
```

#### Memory Class
In embedded systems where no disk drive exists, non-volatile memory is typically a variant of Read-Only Memory (ROM). The **ATMega328P** follows a Harvard architecture, where program code and data are separated. Program code is stored in Flash. Data, on the other hand, can be found in both **SRAM** and **EEPROM**. The microcontroller on the Arduino Uno board has 1KiB of **EEPROM** memory.

You will be using the **EEPROM** to store configuration information, contacts, and messages. The table below describes the memory map implemented for this system. 

| Address       	| Value          	| Purpose                               	|
|---------------	|----------------	|---------------------------------------	|

| 141 - 155 	| Contact Object 	| Contact #9: UUID and Name             	|
| 156 - 170 	| Contact Object 	| Contact #10: UUID and Name            	|
| 171 - 172 	| 0xCA11         	| Message List Flag                     	|
| 173         	| Counter        	| Number of Messages                    	|
| 174 - 186 	| Message Object 	| Message #1                            	|
| 187 - 199 	| Message Object 	| Message #2                            	|

| 434         	| Offset         	| Next available spot @ <Base + Offset> 	|

The memory map consists of the following sections: 

1. **Flags:** There are three flags in the memory map that get verified at every boot for **integrity** and **schema**.

   - **Initialization Flag:** Consists of three bytes (000 - 002) that spell `0xC0FFEE`. These bytes are set during the device's setup stage. 

   - **Contact List Flag:** Consists of two bytes (018 - 019) that spell `0xFACE`. These bytes are set during the device's setup stage and mark the beginning of the contact list related entries in the **EEPROM**.

   - **Message List Flag:** Consists of two bytes (171 - 172) that spell `0xCA11`. These bytes are set during the device's setup stage and mark the beginning of the message list related entries in the **EEPROM**.

2. **Counters:** There are two counter entries in the **EEPROM**. 

   * **Contact Counter**: Keeps track the number of contacts stored in the **EEPROM**. May hold values from 0 to 10. 

   * **Message Counter**: Keeps track the number of messages stored in the **EEPROM**. May hold values from 0 to 20. 

3. **Offsets:** There is one offset entry in the **EEPROM**. According to the memory table above, the base address for the messages (or the address for the first message) is `174`. By adding an offset to this base address we can obtain the position of any message element relative to the first one. The offset entry can store up to **8-bits** of information allowing you to traverse from location `174` all the way to location `429`. This is useful to point to the next location available for saving a message. 

4. **Contact Objects:** The **EEPROM** stores up to 10 contact objects. These objects are **15 bytes** long and contain the contact's **name** and radio's **UUID**. The object located at address `003` contains information regarding the node and is set during setup time. Since we only have room for ten contacts, additional contacts must not be allowed. See the `Contact` class for more information. 

5. **Message Objects:** The **EEPROM** stores up to 20 message objects. These objects are **13 bytes** long and contain information on the sender, the receiver, the payload, and the payload's length. Since we only have room for twenty messages in the given design, we may need to reuse **EEPROM** locations if we receive more than twenty messages. See the `Message` class for more information. 

You will be implementing the `Memory` class that handles writing and reading data to the **EEPROM**. A template is provided below. You must not use Arduino's EEPROM class.

```c++
class Memory {
  public:
    Memory();
    Memory(Contact node);
    unsigned char* getNodeUUID();
    char* getNodeName();
    unsigned short getNumberContacts();
    unsigned short getNumberMessages();
    Contact getContact(unsigned short index);
    Message getMessage(unsigned short index);
    bool saveContact(Contact contact);
    void saveMessage(Message message);
    void saveNodeInformation(Contact contact);
    // Add as you see fit

  protected:
    bool hasSchema();
    void setSchema();
    void clearMessages();
    void clearContacts();
    unsigned short getMessagePointerOffset();
    // Add as you see fit

  private:
    const unsigned short MAX_CONTACTS = 10;
    const unsigned short MAX_MESSAGES = 20;
    // Add as you see fit

};
```

Let's start explaining what each of the functions must do.

* **`Memory()`:** Default constructor for the `Memory` class. Makes sure that the **schema** is set up by verifying the flag bytes. If the **schema** is corrupted or has never been set up, we:
   - Set the **flag** bytes in their appropriate location.
   - Clear the locations reserved for contacts and messages.
   - Reset the contact and messages counters.
   - Reset the offset entry. 

* **`Memory(Contact node)`:** Parametrized constructor for the `Memory` class. Takes a `Contact` object as an argument. The contact object contains the information on the node's **name** and **UUID**. This performs the same operations as the default constructor plus saving the `Contact` object in the space reserved for the node's **name** and **UUID**. 

* **`unsigned char* getNodeUUID()`:** Returns the node's 40-bit **UUID**.

* **`char* getNodeName()`:** Returns the node's **name**.

* **`unsigned short getNumberContacts()`:** Returns the contents of contact counter entry. 

* **`unsigned short getNumberMessages()`:** Returns the contents of messages counter entry. 

* **`Contact getContact(unsigned short index)`:** Returns the `Contact` object specified by the `index`. If `index` points to an unsaved location, return an empty `Contact`. 

* **`Message getMessage(unsigned short index)`:** Returns the `Message` object specified by the `index`. If `index` points to an unsaved location, return an empty `Message`. 

* **`bool saveContact(Contact contact)`:** Saves the given `Contact` object into an empty location in the **EEPROM** and returns `true`. If no more empty locations are available, returns `false`.

* **`void saveMessage(Message message)`:** Saves the given `Message` object into the next available location in the **EEPROM**. Note that this location might have a previous message that will get overwritten if there are no more empty message locations. In other words, after the twenty messages have been saved, the system will overwrite older messages to make room for the new ones.

* **`void saveNodeInformation(Contact contact)`:** Saves the given `Contact` object into the node's contact location.

* **`bool hasSchema()`:** Verifies that the **flag** bytes and **schema** are set for the node. Returns `true` if that's the case, `false` otherwise.

* **`void setSchema()`:** Sets the **flag** bytes and **schema** for the node. 

* **`void clearMessages()`:** Clears the **EEPROM** locations associated with `Message` entries. Resets the messages counter.

* **`void clearContacts()`:** Clears the **EEPROM** locations associated with `Contact` entries. Resets the contacts counter.

* **`unsigned short getMessagePointerOffset()`:** Returns the value of the message pointer offset entry from the **EEPROM**.

#### Contact Class

A `Contact` object stores information on a contact's **name** and **UUID**. The **UUID** is 40-bit long and the contact's name is up to ten characters long. This gives a `Contact` object a size of **15 bytes**. 

1. **Contact's UUID:** The contact's 40-bit **UUID**.

2. **Contact's name:** The contact's **name**. This can hold up to ten characters. 

A template is provided below.

```c++
class Contact {
  public:
    Contact();
    Contact(unsigned char* givenUUID, char const* givenName);
    Contact(unsigned char* givenUUID, char givenName);
    void setUUID(unsigned char* givenUUID);
    void setName(char const* givenName);
    void setName(char givenName);
    unsigned char* getUUID();
    char* getName();
    // Add as you see fit

  private:
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
};
```

Let's start explaining what each of the functions must do.

* **`Contact()`:** Default constructor for the `Contact` class. Creates an empty contact with an empty **name** and empty **UUID**. 

* **`Contact(unsigned char* givenUUID, char const* givenName)`:** Parametrized constructor for the `Contact` class. Takes a given 40-bit **UUID** and a C-style string as parameters to initialize the object's data members. 

* **`Contact(unsigned char* givenUUID, char givenName)`:** Parametrized constructor for the `Contact` class. Takes a given 40-bit **UUID** and a character as parameters to initialize the object's data members. 

* **`void setUUID(unsigned char* givenUUID)`:** Saves the given **UUID** as the contact's **UUID**.

* **`void setName(char const* givenName)`:** Saves the given C-style string as the contact's **name**. Enforces that the contact's **name** is up to ten characters long by truncating the excess characters.

* **`void setName(char givenName)`:** Saves the given character as the contact's **name**. 

* **`unsigned char* getUUID()`:** Returns the contact's 40-bit **UUID**. 

* **`char* getName()`:** Returns the contact's name as a C-style string. 

#### Message Class

A `Message` object stores the **UUID** of the sender and the receiver, alongside with the payload and its length. This gives a `Message` object the size of **13 bytes**.

1. **Sender's UUID:** The sender's 40-bit **UUID**.

2. **Receivers's UUID:** The receiver's 40-bit **UUID**. Used to verify that message was received by the intended party.

3. **Payload:** The payload consists of **morse code** messages that may vary in size. Their size cannot exceed 16 characters (since that's the maximum amount we can display on the LCD screen). Morse code uses the **`.`** and the **`-`** symbols and we will represent these with **zeroes** and **ones** respectively. This allows us to represent each character with a bit instead of a byte. We need 2 bytes to represent up to 16 characters.

4. **Payload Length:** Since a message can vary in **length**, the payload length tells us how many bits are valid to be interpreted as part of the message. We use 1 byte to store the payload's length.

A template is provided below.

```cpp
class Message {
  public:
    Message();
    Message(unsigned char* from, unsigned char* to, unsigned short payload, unsigned char length);
    Message(unsigned char* from, unsigned char* to, char const* message);
    void setLength(unsigned char length);
    void setTo(unsigned char* to);
    void setFrom(unsigned char* from);
    void setPayload(unsigned short payload);
    unsigned char getLength();
    unsigned char* getTo();
    unsigned char* getFrom();
    unsigned short getPayload();
    char* getPayloadString();

  protected:
    unsigned short stringToPayload(char const* message);
    char* payloadToString(unsigned short payload, unsigned char length);

  private:
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
};
```

Let's start explaining what each of the functions must do.

* **`Message()`:** Default constructor for the `Message` class. Creates an empty message. 

* **`Message(unsigned char* from, unsigned char* to, unsigned short payload, unsigned char length)`:** Parametrized constructor for the `Message` class. Takes the sender and receiver's **UUIDs**, the **payload**, and its **length**. 

* **`Message(unsigned char* from, unsigned char* to, char const* message)`:** Parametrized constructor for the `Message` class. Takes the sender and receiver's **UUIDs**. Additionally, it takes a message in a C-style string. The payload **length** is calculated after the conversion from a C-style string to the payload bits. 

* **`void setLength(unsigned char length)`:** Sets the **length** of the payload for the `Message` object.

* **`void setTo(unsigned char* to)`:** Sets the receiver's **UUID** for the `Message` object.

* **`void setFrom(unsigned char* from)`:** Sets the sender's **UUID** for the `Message` object.

* **`void setPayload(unsigned short payload)`:** Sets the **payload** for the `Message` object.

* **`unsigned char getLength()`:** Returns the payload's **length**.

* **`unsigned char* getTo()`:** Returns the receiver's **UUID**.

* **`unsigned char* getFrom()`:** Returns the sender's **UUID**.

* **`unsigned short getPayload()`:** Returns the **payload**.

* **`char* getPayloadString()`:** Returns the **decoded** version of the **payload** in a C-style string. 

* **`unsigned short stringToPayload(char const* message)`:** **Encodes** up to a 16 character Morse code string into a 16 bit buffer. Returns the result of this encoding.

* **`char* payloadToString(unsigned short payload, unsigned char length)`:** **Decodes** a payload into a C-style string. Uses the payload's length to determine the size of the resulting string. Returns the decoded string.

#### State Machine
We have modeled the beeper as a **state machine** based on its behavior. Take a look at the diagram below.

![statemachine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaviermerino/ECE2551-SoftHardDesign/master/MorseBeeper/statemachine.png)

The following states can be identified:

* **Setup**: First time boot. User enters his name and a UUID gets generated. User information is stored in the EEPROM. Subsequent boots skip this state and start in the `Menu` state.
  * **SELECT**: Saves the user's name and goes to the main menu.
  * **LEFT**: Erases the last character and moves cursor to the left.
  * **RIGHT**: Confirms character moves cursor to right.
  * **UP**: Scrolls letter
  * **DOWN**: Scrolls letter
  
* **Menu**: Displays the menu options. There are blinking arrows on the ends of the second row. These arrows indicate that the user can press the Left or Right buttons to scroll to the next option. The options wrap around once all have been displayed. The arrows complete a blink cycle in a second.
  * **SELECT**: Goes to the selected option. The following is a list of valid menu options.
    * **Contacts**: Goes to `Contacts`.
    * **Messages**: Goes to `Messages`.
    * **N. Contact**: Goes to `New Contact`.
    * **About Me**: Goes to `About Me`.
  * **LEFT**: Scrolls options.
  * **RIGHT**: Scrolls options.
  * **UP**: None
  * **DOWN**: None
  
* **Contacts**: Displays the contacts stored in the device. There are blinking arrows on the ends of the second row. These arrows indicate that the user can press the Left or Right buttons to scroll to the next option. The options wrap around once all have been displayed. The arrows complete a blink cycle in a second.
  * **SELECT**: Compose message for selected contact.
  * **LEFT**: Scrolls contact options.
